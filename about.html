				<p><strong class="mimic-h">I</strong>n the beginning, the Internet was made up of only 
				a handful of web sites and homepages. It wasn't long before someone
				decided to bestow honors on the best of these creations. Before you 
				knew it, Glenn Davis had started up Cool Site of the Day. Suddenly, 
				everyone who could afford proper <a>webhosting</a> with half a knowledge of 
				HTML and the ability to draw straight lines began to think they could 
				make a decent (and cool) homepage. Nuh-uh. The infamous Mirsky rose to 
				the occasion and <a>Mirsky's Worst of the Web</a> was born. Tired of the whole 
				process, Mirsky hung up his hat and the awful side of the web is left 
				unchecked... until now. This is the Worst of the Web™.</p>

				<h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
				<p>Every Weekday, we (<a>Buzz</a>, <a>Melvin</a>, and <a>Chip</a>) will showcase new sites 
				peppered with our own ripping comments served up in two different ways. 
				For those of you who grew to love the ease and simple style of Mirsky's 
				original work, we've created the <a>classic style</a>. However, for those of 
				you who want to play with a horde of Netscape 4+ enhanced features, 
				we've created the <a>new style</a> for Worst of the Web™. Be sure to vote on 
				how bad the new featured site stinks every day!</p>

				<p>The <a>classic</a> style is fairly straight-forward. You'll be presented 
				with the sites for each day along with our comments on one page.</p>

				<p>The <a>new style</a> is divided into borderless frames allowing you to 
				determine which comments you wish to see while viewing the Worst of the 
				Web™ chosen site. Each critic's comment will appear inside a speech 
				balloon after you've clicked on his face. The site we are reviewing 
				will also be on the page for you to peruse.</p>

				<p>That's basically it. Either style you choose will get you to your 
				dose of the worst.</p>

				<p>We're always on the lookout for sites that are Worst of the Web 
				material. If you have one that you feel should be reviewed here -- by 
				all means, <a>send it in!</a></p>

				<p>We'd also like to send out a special thanks to <a>-RoG-</a> for some 
				especially poignant commentary that we have used in our own comments.</p>

				<h3>For Those Of You Who Are Reviewed</h3>
				<p>For those of you who have been reviewed on our site, 
				congratulations! Tons of people now know that you're off your rocker. 
				We invite those of our winners with enough guts to download our coveted 
				"Worst of the Web™ Busted Trophy" icon and slap it on their homepage or 
				web site. Then, sit back, look around at what you've created and hire a 
				professional web team to remedy your site! It's awful!</p>
