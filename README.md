# worstoftheweb-refactor

### Considering ideas from Refactor UI about text, colors and depth for UI design, I chose to...

- use softer blues because I wanted to tone down the harshness of straight blue.
- arrange the text and font sizes so things would look more consistent and
sections would have more room to breathe.
- make the disclaimer on the main page much lighter, following hierarchy principles.
- give the drop shadows of buttons and about page the same direction because the
lighting should feel consistent too.
- add a simple hover effect for the about page menu elements for a little extra
flair.
- keep the image at the top of the about page because I felt the trio of 
characters was an important part of the design, but I removed the lo-fi background.
