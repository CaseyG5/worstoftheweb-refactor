				<h2>In the Beginning. . .</h2>
				<p>The Internet was made up of only 
				a handful of web sites and homepages. &nbsp;It wasn't long before someone
				decided to bestow honors on the best of these creations. &nbsp;Before you 
				knew it, Glenn Davis had started up Cool Site of the Day. &nbsp;Suddenly, 
				everyone who could afford proper
				<a href="http://www.webhostingsearch.com/">webhosting</a> with half the
				knowledge of HTML and the ability to draw straight lines began to think
				they could make a decent (and cool) homepage.
				Nuh-uh. &nbsp;The infamous Mirsky rose to the occasion and 
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirsky's_Worst_of_the_Web/">Mirsky's 
				Worst of the Web</a>
				was born. &nbsp;Tired of the whole process, Mirsky hung up his hat and the awful
				side of the web was left unchecked...until now. &nbsp;This is the Worst of the
				Web™.</p>

				<h3>How It Works</h3>
				<p>Every Weekday, we (<a href="http://www.worstoftheweb.com/about/buzz.html">Buzz</a>,
				<a href="http://www.worstoftheweb.com/about/melvin.html">Melvin</a>, and
				<a href="http://www.worstoftheweb.com/about/chip.html">Chip</a>) will showcase 
				new sites peppered with our own ripping comments served up in two different ways. &nbsp;
				For those of you who grew to love the ease and simple style of Mirsky's 
				original work, we've created the
				<a href="http://www.worstoftheweb.com/classic/">classic style</a>. &nbsp;However, for 
				those of you who want to play with a horde of Netscape 4+ enhanced features, 
				we've created the <a href="http://www.worstoftheweb.com/new/">new style</a> for 
				Worst of the Web™. &nbsp;Be sure to vote on how bad the new featured site stinks 
				every day!</p>

				<p>The <a href="http://www.worstoftheweb.com/classic/">classic</a> style is 
				fairly straight-forward. &nbsp;You'll be presented with the sites for each day along 
				with our comments on one page.</p>

				<p>The <a href="http://www.worstoftheweb.com/new/">new style</a> is divided 
				into borderless frames allowing you to determine which comments you wish to see 
				while viewing the Worst of the Web™ chosen site. &nbsp;Each critic's comment will 
				appear inside a speech 
				balloon after you've clicked on his face. &nbsp;The site we are reviewing 
				will also be on the page for you to peruse.</p>

				<p>That's basically it. &nbsp;Either style you choose will get you to your 
				dose of the worst.</p>

				<p>We're always on the lookout for sites that are Worst of the Web 
				material. &nbsp;If you have one that you feel should be reviewed here then by 
				all means, <a href="http://www.worstoftheweb.com/cgi-bin/submit.cgi">send it in!</a></p>

				<p>We'd also like to send out a special thanks to
				<a href="http://www.i-mockery.com">-RoG-</a> for some especially poignant
				commentary that we have used in our own comments.</p>

				<h3>If You Are Reviewed</h3>
				<img src="trophy.gif" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px"/>
				<p>For those of you who have been reviewed on our site, 
				congratulations! &nbsp;Tons of people now know that you're off your rocker. &nbsp;
				We invite those of our winners with enough guts to download our coveted 
				"Worst of the Web™ Busted Trophy" icon and slap it on their homepage or 
				web site. &nbsp;Then, sit back, look around at what you've created and hire a 
				professional web team to remedy your site! &nbsp;It's awful!</p>
