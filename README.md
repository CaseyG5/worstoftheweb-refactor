### Considering ideas from the eBook about text, colors and depth for UI design, I chose to...

- use softer blues because I wanted to tone down the harshness of straight blue.
- arrange the text and font sizes so things would look more orderly/consistent and
sections would have more room to breathe, thus improving readability.
- make the disclaimer on the main page lighter, following hierarchy principles.
- give the drop shadows of buttons and about page the same direction because the
lighting should feel consistent too.
- keep the images on the about page because I felt the trophy and the trio of 
characters was an important part of the design, but I removed the lo-fi background pattern.
- add a simple hover effect for the about page menu elements for a tiny bit of flair.

Overall I think these improvements make the pages more organized and easier on the eyes of the viewer. However,
I'm not sure the stylistic value has increased.  You be the judge.
